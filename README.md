Necromancer is a powerful, intelligent Discord bot designed to streamline the complex process of scheduling for gaming teams. It automates availability polls, generates optimal rosters based on player preferences, and manages event reminders, letting you focus on the game, not the logistics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Automated Availability Polls**: Posts clear, interactive polls for players to mark their availability for the upcoming week.
-   **Intelligent Roster Generation**: Suggest draft rosters that prioritize the team's preferred days and players' preferred roles.
-   **Advanced Role Management**: Configure team roles and integrate substitute players (`@Ringer`) seamlessly.
-   **Nuanced Preferences**: Supports `Available`, `Prefer Not`, and `Unavailable` states for more flexible scheduling.
